# SLAM
In this project, I implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2-dimensional world.  Sensor and motion data gathered by a simulated robot is used to create a map of an environment. SLAM gives us a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, etc.

There are no special requirements for this project to do with GPUs or external files. This project can be run as is.
